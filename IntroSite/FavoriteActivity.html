		<h3>Biking as a new hobby</h3>
   		<p>This summer I started a new hobby of biking. I used to play tennis and wanted to find something to stay active consistently
		I had absouloutley no idea where to start. I started by watching many Youtube videos to see what was out there
		and have something to get started from. I narrowed my searching down to road biking. In the world of road biking there was 
		so much to learn about. Where to start...? Well I had to first get a bike.</p>
		
		<br/>
		<p>This is where I started looking for bikes:</p>
		<a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/performance-road-bikes/" target="_blank">Trek Home Page</a>
		<br/>
		<p>Then I looked here: </p>
		<a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/shop/bikes/road-bikes/performance-road-bikes/tarmac/c/tarmac" target="_blank">

		</a>
		<br/>
		<p>I did a lot of searching around and there was so many to choose from. Not only were there so many bike manufactured in the US, there were so many that were sold in different</br>
		retail stores. Dick's, Walmart, etc... All these stores sold different types of road bikes. There were even more options found on amazon lol. My head was spinning after just one</br>

		<h4>Here is a list of different Bike Brands that I found:</h4>
		<ul>
			<span id="SpecialTrek"><li>Trek</li></span>
			<li>Specialized</li>
			<li>Huffy</li>
			<li>Limonade</li>
			<li>Dakine</li>
			<li>Cannondale</li>
			<li>Yada Yada Yada...</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<h4>These are what I narrowed it down to</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Trek</li>
			<li>Specialized</li>
			<li>Huffy</li>
		</ol>

		<br/>
		<span>
		<p>To buy a brand new bike would cost at a minimum of $1000. This was way over my budget and was not worth the money as a<br/>
			beginner. I went to Erik's bike shop and to see the bike's that they had and it was the same story. I wasn't sure what<br/>
			I was going to do.
